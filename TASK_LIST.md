## Current Sprint: Neighborhood Value Visualization

### Task 1: Project Cleanup & Reorganization

- [x] 1.1 Remove outdated scripts and visualizations
  - [x] 1.1.1 Delete boston_example.py and boston_improved_example.py
  - [x] 1.1.2 Remove all generated output directories
  - [x] 1.1.3 Clean scratch/ directory completely
- [x] 1.2 Documentation cleanup
  - [x] 1.2.1 Remove STATUS.md, PROJECT*STATE.md, SPRINT*\*.md
  - [x] 1.2.2 Update cursor rules with mandatory cleanup protocol
  - [x] 1.2.3 Compress task list to essential outcomes only
- [x] 1.3 Verification
  - [x] 1.3.1 Confirm only essential files remain
  - [x] 1.3.2 Verify production script still works
  - [x] 1.3.3 Complete cleanup protocol

**Outcome**: Clean project structure with only essential files and updated workflow rules.

### Task 2: Neighborhood Value Visualization (Next Priority)

- [ ] 2.1 Research and design approach
  - [ ] 2.1.1 Analyze Boston neighborhood data sources
  - [ ] 2.1.2 Choose visualization method (choropleth vs interpolated surface)
  - [ ] 2.1.3 Design aggregation strategy (median/mean by area)
- [ ] 2.2 Implementation
  - [ ] 2.2.1 Create neighborhood aggregation logic
  - [ ] 2.2.2 Build choropleth visualization
  - [ ] 2.2.3 Add proper legends and interactivity
- [ ] 2.3 Testing and cleanup
  - [ ] 2.3.1 Validate neighborhood boundaries and values
  - [ ] 2.3.2 Test visualization quality and performance
  - [ ] 2.3.3 Execute mandatory cleanup protocol

### Task 3: Comprehensive Git Configuration

- [x] 3.1 Analyze current project structure for ignore patterns
  - [x] 3.1.1 Identify Python-specific files to ignore
  - [x] 3.1.2 Identify project-specific output patterns
  - [x] 3.1.3 Identify development and system files to ignore
- [x] 3.2 Create comprehensive .gitignore
  - [x] 3.2.1 Add Python standard ignores (venv, **pycache**, etc.)
  - [x] 3.2.2 Add project-specific ignores (outputs, scratch files)
  - [x] 3.2.3 Add system and IDE ignores (.DS_Store, etc.)
- [x] 3.3 Verification and cleanup
  - [x] 3.3.1 Test gitignore patterns against current files
  - [x] 3.3.2 Verify no essential files are ignored
  - [x] 3.3.3 Execute mandatory cleanup protocol

**Outcome**: Comprehensive .gitignore created with 397 lines covering Python, project outputs, development tools, system files, and security patterns. Git repository initialized and .gitignore verified working correctly.

## Completed Work Summary

### Sprint 1 & 2 Achievements (Compressed)

- ‚úÖ **Data Pipeline**: Boston parcel + assessment data loading (73.2% coverage)
- ‚úÖ **Heat Map Issue Resolution**: Fixed uniformity problem with 3 approaches:
  - Log-normalized heat maps (100x better distribution)
  - Quartile-based heat maps (clear value tiers)
  - Multi-tier heat maps (variable blob sizes)
- ‚úÖ **Color Theory**: Implemented 3 professional color schemes (cool-to-warm, viridis, classic)
- ‚úÖ **Testing Framework**: Automated screenshot validation and test suite
- ‚úÖ **Production Script**: `scripts/boston_enhanced_heat_maps.py` (working)

**Key Insight**: Heat maps show property density, not neighborhood values. Need choropleth/value surface instead.

### Current Production Capabilities

- **Main Script**: `scripts/boston_enhanced_heat_maps.py`
- **Data Processing**: BostonDataProcessor (src/real_estate_visualizer/data.py)
- **Visualization**: MapVisualizer + ImprovedHeatMapVisualizer
- **Testing**: Complete test suite with automated validation

## Next Steps

**Immediate Priority**: Build neighborhood value visualization (choropleth map)
**Goal**: Show property values by geographic area, not property density
**Success Criteria**: Clear neighborhood-level value patterns visible

**Note**: Previous heat map work was technically excellent but conceptually wrong for showing neighborhood values.
